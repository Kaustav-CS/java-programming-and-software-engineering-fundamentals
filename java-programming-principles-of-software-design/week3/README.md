# What I learned from this module
1. base random text generation on the frequency of characters in a training text,
1. collect a set of characters that occur in a text after randomly chosen initial character(s) to create a semi-random text,
1. extend the predictive text generation to use whole words, and
1. implement your own .equals method to compare complex data types.
